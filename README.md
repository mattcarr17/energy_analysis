# Energy Analysis

[Project Article and Updates](https://www.mattcarrhq.com/energy-analysis-rag-application-for-u-s-energy-data/)

My goal is to build a full-stack RAG application that allows users to interact with U.S. energy industry data through a language model. A note from when I first started outlining this project: "I want to organize as much energy industry related data as possible and place an LLM on top of it."

What I aim to include:
- A simple front-end interface where users can ask questions, receive responses, and view visuals if relevant.
- The ability to choose the LLM being used.
- Options to adjust the back-end prompt sent to the model.
- A feature to rate model responses.
- A log of previous questions, responses, ratings, etc. (The first iteration might not include a chatbot interface.)
- A pipeline to seamlessly upload additional data sources.

I hope to expand the scope in time. My primary goal is to learn what is involved in building and deploying an application like this. Most of my previous projects have stayed on local servers, so a key goal here is to use Docker and a cloud service to make this a proper web application.
